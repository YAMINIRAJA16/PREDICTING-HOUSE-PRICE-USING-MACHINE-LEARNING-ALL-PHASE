#Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts house prices. The model is built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

Python 3.x: You can download it from python.org.
pip: A package manager for Python. It usually comes pre-installed with Python 3.x.
Virtual Environment (optional but recommended): To create an isolated Python environment for this project, you can use the virtualenv package.
pip install virtuale

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains detailed information about various features of residential properties, including their prices. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle competition or use your own dataset.

The dataset contains the following information:

Various numerical and categorical features like the number of bedrooms, area, location, etc.
Sale prices of houses, which are the target values.
You can use your own dataset or download one from sources like Kaggle. Make sure to place your dataset in the data directory.

#Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Activate your virtual environment (if you created one).

Run the train.py script to train the model:
python train.py
This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it to a file for later use.

After training, you can use the predict.py script to make predictions on new data. Provide the input data in CSV format:

python predict.py input_data.csv
The script will load the trained model and generate predictions for the provided data.

#Configuration
You can adjust the model's hyperparameters and other settings in the config.py file.
